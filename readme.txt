Install:
- World of Warcraft install folder -> _retail_ -> Interface 
- Create folder "Tooltips" (ONLY IF it doesn't exist)
- Copy the content from the chat bubble folder u want to use (overwrite the existing files, DO NOT RENAME them!!!)
- Restart World of Warcraft


If you use ElvUI or another UI Addon make sure to disable the custom chat bubble feature!

Disclaimer: Just like the ElvUi login screen rep, this is NOT MY work, I'm simply re-uploading it due to the original location being unreachable!
